# The ATM problem
Banknote dispenser logic of an ATM.

# User stories
- As a user I want to be able to enter the amount I want to withdraw from the ATM (I
always have enough money in my bank account)
- As a user I want to see what bills the ATM gives me - if able - once I entered and
submitted the desired amount
- As a user I want to see an error message if the ATM is unable to give the desired
amount due to the lack of appropriate bills
- As an operator I want to see the withdrawal history including time, success status and
amount as well as the remaining notes in the ATM
- As an operator I want to be able to see and manipulate the amount of each bill in the
ATM

# Extra Info
- This ATM is only filled with the following notes: 20000, 10000, 5000, 2000 (note there is no
1000 bill)
- The withdrawal history and the state of the notes of the ATM should be kept up to date after
each action (withdrawal or note manipulation)
